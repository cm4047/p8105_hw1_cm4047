This is my solution to HW1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

##Problem 1
Create a data frame:
```{r}
prob1_df = tibble(
        sample = rnorm(10),
        sample_greater_0 = sample > 0,
        char_vector = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
        fac_vector = factor(c("small", "small", "samll", "medium", "medium", "medium", "large", "large", "large", "large"))
)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
